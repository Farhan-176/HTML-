    <hr>
    <P>An <b>Electronic Cigarette</b> (E-cigarette) or <B><i>Vape</i></B> is a device that simulates tobacco smoking.
        <br>
        It consists of an
    <ul>
        <li>Atomizer</li>
        <li>A Power source such as a battery</li>
        <li>A Container such as a cartridge or tank filled with liquid</li>
    </ul>
    Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor.As such, using an <STrong>E-cigarette</STrong> is often called
    <B>"Vaping"</B>. <br>

    <p> As Mitchelle obama said:
    <blockquote><q><b>Vaping: a trend that clouds our future.</b></q></blockquote>
    </p>
    The atomizer is a heating element that vaporizes a liquid solution called <I> <dfn>e-liquid</dfn></I>,which quickly
    cools into
    an aerosol of tiny droplets, vapor and air.E-cigarettes are activated by taking a puff or pressing a
    button. Some look like traditional cigarettes, and most kinds are reusable.</P>

    <p>Vaping is likely far less harmful than smoking, but still harmful. E-cigarette vapor contains fewer
        toxins than cigarette smoke. It contains traces of harmful substances not found in cigarette smoke such as
        <strong>Nicotine</strong> is highly addictive. Users become physically and psychologically dependent. because it
        is hard to separate the effects of vaping from the effects of smoking when so many people both vape and smoke
    </p>

    <p>Now we will Discuss some features of <strong>Vape</strong> that is written below:
    <ol>
        <li><b>
                <h2>Construction</h2>
            </b></li>
        <p>E-cigarettes have evolved over time, and the different designs are classified in generations.
        <ul>
            <li><em><b>1<sup>st</sup> -generation</b></em> e-cigarettes tend to look like traditional cigarettes and are
                called "cigalikes".</li>
            <img width="300px"  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Electronic_Cigarette_and_USB_Charger_%2814939561277%29_%28retouched%29.jpg/1280px-Electronic_Cigarette_and_USB_Charger_%2814939561277%29_%28retouched%29.jpg"
                alt="first generation Ciagratte">
            <li><em><b>2<sup>nd</sup>-generation </b></em>devices are larger and look less like traditional cigarettes.
            </li>
            <li><em><b>3<sup>rd</sup>-generation</b></em>devices include mechanical mods and variable voltage devices
            </li>
            <li><em><b>The 4<sup>th</sup>-generation </b></em>includes sub-ohm tanks (meaning they have electrical
                resistance of less than 1 ohm) and temperature control</li>
        </ul>
        There are also pod mod devices that use protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier
        generations,providing higher nicotine yields.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><em>
                    <h4>E-Liquid :</h4>
                </em></b>
            The mixture used in vapor products such as e-cigarettes is called e-liquid.E-liquid formulations vary
            widely.A typical e-liquid is composed of propylene glycol and glycerin (95%) and a combination of
            flavorings, nicotine, and other additives (5%).
        </p>
        <li><b>
                <h2>Use</h2>
            </b></li>
        <p>
            Since entering the market around 2003, e-cigarette use has risen rapidly.In 2011 there were about <B>7
                million
                adult</B> e-cigarette users globally, increasing to <B>68 million in 2020</B> compared with <B>1.1
                billion
                cigarette smokers</B>.There was a further rise to <B>82 million</B> e-cigarette users in
            <B><I>2021</I></B>.E-cigarette use is
            highest in <strong>China, the US, and Europe,</strong> with <strong>China</strong> having the most users.
        </p>
        <li><b>
                <h2>Health effects</h2>
            </b></li>
        <p>
            The health risks of e-cigarettes are not known for certain, but the risk of serious adverse events is
            thought to be low,and e-cigarettes are likely safer than combusted tobacco products.However, this does not
            mean that e-cigarettes are harmless. E-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of <dfn>chronic
                obstructive pulmonary disease</dfn>,<dfn>asthma</dfn> ,<dfn>chronic bronchitis</dfn>, and
            <dfn>emphysema</dfn>.
            Those who use e-cigarettes daily have higher risk than those who use them occasionally.According to the
            <B><abbr title="National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine">NASM</abbr></B>,<Q>Laboratory
                tests of e-cigarette
                ingredients, in
                vitro toxicological tests, and short-term human studies suggest that e-cigarettes are likely to be far
                less
                harmful than combustible tobacco cigarettes.</Q>

                <h2>History</h2>
            </b></li>
        <p>
            It is commonly stated that the modern e-cigarette was invented in 2003 by Chinese <strong>pharmacist Hon
                Lik</strong>, but
            tobacco companies had been developing nicotine aerosol generation devices since as early as 1963.
            The stage of History of tabacoo is defined as below:
        <ul>
            <li>Early prototypes & barriers to entry: 1920s – 90s</li>
            <li>Modern electronic cigarette: 2000s</li>
            <li>nternational growth: 2010s – present</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <li><b>
                <h2>Related technologies</h2>
            </b></li>
        <p>
            Other devices to deliver inhaled nicotine have been developed. They aim to mimic the ritual and
            behavioral aspects of traditional cigarettes.
            <strong>British American Tobacco</strong>, through their subsidiary Nicoventures, licensed a nicotine
            delivery system based on existing asthma inhaler technology from UK-based healthcare company Kind
            Consumer.In September 2014
            a product based on this named Voke obtained approval from the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare
            Products Regulatory Agency.
